# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game-Python-For-Beginners
This is a basic command-line game of Rock, Paper, Scissors built in Python. It's a great project for beginners to understand core programming concepts like functions, user input, and conditional logic.

**How It Works**
The game is structured into several simple functions:

**Player Input:** It asks the user to choose 'r' for Rock, 'p' for Paper, or 's' for Scissors. The code ensures you can't enter anything else, so you have to pick one of the three.

**Alexa's Turn:** The computer makes its move by randomly selecting one of the three choices.I named computer choice as **Alexa**__

**Checking for a Winner:** The game compares your choice to the Alexa's choice. It first checks for a draw and then applies the classic rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine the winner.

**Playing the Game:** Finally, a main function ties everything together. It runs the game and prints out the results, telling you what both you and the Alexa picked, and who won.

**Feel free to download and run it to play against the computer!**
